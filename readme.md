This is RV64 emulator with some pheripherals

This emulator is capable of booting xv6 (very slowly, though)

This code is not ideal, not optimal and not entirely original (see: [Rare](https://github.com/siriusdemon/Rare) and [Asami's og tutorial](https://book.rvemu.app/)), but It is perfect for learning and future reference. Following this tutorial and RV Specs was (sometimes)tedious and challenging, but while doing that, I learn ALOT about RISC-V, CPU design, assembly, xv6, C and rust.

Use this code/project however you like.

Note: I reimplemented some things myself, various parts will differ from tutorial
